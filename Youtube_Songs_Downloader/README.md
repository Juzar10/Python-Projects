# Download-all-songs-from-youtube-playlist
It uses selenium and opens your browser and downloads all songs from your youtube playlist

## How to use it?
1st you need to give path to your browser web driver on you pc to this python file. if you don't know how to do it then you can watch video of youtube channel tech-with-tim to understand about selenium he has whole playlist about selenium.

Then you need to run the file and paste link(youtube playlist link) in the terminal after message.

It will open your browser window couple of times.

## How it works?

It gets your youtube link and open your playlist and makes the list of all the songs in your playlist.

Then it closes the window and re open it to the new website to download youtube video and it place the link to every video and downloads it.



### Some Draw-backs

You have to have study internet connection because if you lose it and programm terminates I have not added any functionality that will let you know where you have left off.

You can create text file insted of python list and iterate over it for backup purposes in case of lost internet connection.

It also depends on server speed of third party web-site for youtube video download.
